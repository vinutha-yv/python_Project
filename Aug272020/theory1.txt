# Programs Notes:

return 0 -> Meaning?
return 1 -> Meaning?

# For execution of program python p2_calc.py

Conditions for checking 
    addition: 
        Nothing
    subtraction: 
        num1 == num2
        num1 > num2
        num2 > num1
    multiplication:
        Nothing
    division:
        num1 == num2 
            if num1 = 0, then division by 0 not posible
        num1 > num2
            if num2 = 0, then division by 0 not posible
            else division possible
        num2 > num1
            if num1 = 0, then division by 0 not posible
            else division possible

** Important points of above program:

    how to use f in print statement
    when to use return 0, return 1-> What it does?
