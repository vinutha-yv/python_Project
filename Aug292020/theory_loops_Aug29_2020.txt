Python is a high-level language, inpterpreted object oriented scripting language.

Interpreted
interactive
object - oriented

beginner's language
easy to learn, read, maintain
broad standard library
interactive mode
portable
extendable
Database support
GUI programming
Scalable
scripting language
dynamic typing and dynamic type checking
automatic garbage collection

programming paradigms
    Procedural
    Functional
    Structural
    Object oriented programming

time taken for code development -> 
time taken for writing the code + time taken for executing the code 

cPython -> C + Python
Jpython -> Java + Python
IronPython -> C# + Python
PyPy (dont get confused by this - PyPI) -> Python + Python

all the softwares/ applications/code is made up of mainly 2 things-
    variables - value set
    functions

values
    Primary data types
varaibles - memory location of the values stored

operation - 
    decision making
    looping

decision making
    python assumes any non-zero and not null values as True, and if the value is 0 or Null, that determines to False.

Single statement, multiple statements
a single if can work. elif and else would not work without if


if expression is True:
    do this
elif expression is True:
    do this
elif expression is True:
    do this
elif expression is True:
    do this
elif expression is True:
    do this
elif expression is True:
    do this
else: (if nothing is True)
    do this


Loops:
    allows us to execute a statement or a group of statement for 
        a fixed number of times, 
        or for a fixed set of values 
        or until a particular condition is met.

    for
        a fixed number of times-> allows us to change the contents inside the box
            for number in range(fixed_number_of_times):
                # do something
        or for a fixed set of values
            for value in set_of_values:
                # do something
    while
        or until a particular condition is met.


range(start, stop, (direction)step), range only returns integer values
        0               +       1
range(5) = 0 till 5 -> 0 upto 4 when iterated   

range(4, 10) => 4,5,6,7,8,9 when looped

Python chr() and ord()

Python's built-in function chr() is used for converting an Integer to a Character, 
while the function ord() is used to do the reverse, i.e, convert a Character to an Integer.

The input() function allows user input.


Important: (0 - 127)
    Ascii Codes     Symbol
    48 - 57         0 - 9
    65 - 90         A - Z
    97 - 122        a - z
    Rest all are symbols.

loop control statements
    break -> terminated the loop statement and transfers execution  to the statement immediately following the loop
    continue -> causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and work on the next iteration
    pass - > do nothing


***For trying inside python:
    >>> for i in range(4, 8):
...     print(i)
